# Command list comments

This document contains my notes in order to follow the full stack course.

The first things I learned is about terminal commands as:

1. `pwd`: print working directory
2. `hostnam`: my computer's network name
3. `mkdir`: makes a directory
4. `cd`: change directory
5. `ls`: list directory
6. `rmdir`: remove directory `rm` The rm command deletes files and directories. `rm` The -r stands for "recursive," and it's used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.
7. `pushd`: push directory
8. `popd`: popdirectory
9. `cp`: copy a file or directory
10. `mv` move a file or directory
```
mv superman.txt superhero/
mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
```
`mv` also rename a file
```
mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
```

11. `sudo`: DANGER! become super user root DANGER!
12. `cp` copy a file in a directory, cp + source file + destination directory: 

```
cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/
```
