It is important to have in mind that a good site must be 100% semantic.

tag a(href = x)
it is the capacity to link documents, in this case all this documents are the www (word wide web)

it introduces semantic to a text (it provide a rol to this content - each piece of contetnt have a clear mission)

This is important due it permits that vision or hearing dissable people could acces to the information.

Also helps to the website positionating due Google can know about your page.

## Layers of a website: 

1. content .html
2. presentation or design .css
3. behavior .js

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```


<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<section></section>
<aside></aside>

##The fundamental points:

Web documents are ordinary text files (ASCII) that:
Contain tags, which are used to "mark-up" text.
Are named with a ".html" extension.
Are placed in a "www-data" directory within AFS public space.
Tags are just text with a special format:
Each individual tag begins with the character "<"
Each individual tag ends with the character ">"
A tag may contain keywords, the first of which is the name of the tag. 
e.g., <XYZ KEY=VALUE> would be called an "XYZ-tag."
Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag, and a closing tag, which has the same name preceded by a "/".
The text between the two tags is affected by them.
The tags we have discussed are:
<HTML> First tag in a document (unpaired).
<HEAD> Marks the head section (paired).
<BODY> Marks the body section (paired).
<TITLE> Title (goes in head section) (paired).
<P> Paragraph break (unpaired).
<BR> Line break (unpaired).
<HR> Horizontal rule (line) (unpaired).
<PRE> Preformatted text (paired).
<EM> Emphasis (usually italics) (paired).
<STRONG> Stronger emphasis (paired).
<B> Bold (text attribute) (paired).
<I> Italics (text attribute) (paired).
<H1> Level 1 (e.g., document) heading (paired).
<H2> Level 2 (e.g., part) heading (paired).
<H3> Level 3 (e.g., chapter) heading (paired).
<H4> Level 4 (e.g., section) heading (paired).
<H5> Level 5 (e.g., subsection) heading (paired).
<H6> Level 6 (e.g., paragraph) heading (paired).
